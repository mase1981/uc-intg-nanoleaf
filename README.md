## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

**Problem**: Integration setup fails with "No Devices Found"

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure Remote Two/3 and Nanoleaf devices on same network
   - Test: ping from Remote to device IP
   - Check firewall settings
2. **Check Device Status**:
   - Verify devices are powered on and connected to WiFi
   - Test devices work in Nanoleaf app
   - Ensure firmware is 3.0+ for API support
3. **Network Discovery**:
   - Wait longer for mDNS discovery (up to 10 seconds)
   - Try manual IP entry if auto-discovery fails
   - Check for network congestion

**Problem**: Device pairing fails during setup

**Solutions**:
1. **Timing Issues**:
   - Press ALL device power buttons within 5 seconds
   - Click "Continue" immediately after pressing buttons
   - Ensure LEDs are flashing before proceeding
2. **Device State**:
   - Verify devices are not already paired to another system
   - Reset devices if previously paired
   - Try pairing one device at a time
3. **Network Issues**:
   - Check network stability during pairing
   - Ensure no network interruptions
   - Move closer to devices if WiFi signal weak

**Problem**: "Connection Refused" or HTTP errors

**Solutions**:
1. **API Port Access**:
   ```bash
   # Test API connectivity
   curl http://DEVICE_IP:16021/api/v1/
   # Expected: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (normal for unauthenticated)
   ```
2. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Ensure port 16021 is accessible
   - Check router/firewall settings
   - Temporarily disable firewall for testing
3. **Device API Status**:
   - Verify API is enabled (default on modern firmware)
   - Check device manual for API requirements
   - Update firmware if API not working

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: Device commands not working

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Device Status**:
   - Verify devices are online and responsive
   - Test manual control through Nanoleaf app
   - Check power and network connections
2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Auth tokens may have expired
   - Re-run integration setup to refresh tokens
   - Check if devices were reset
3. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure stable local network connection
   - Test ping to device IP addresses
   - Check for network congestion
4. **Device Capability**:
   - Some effects may not be available on all models
   - Check device manual for supported features
   - Verify firmware compatibility

**Problem**: "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Token Expiration**:
   - Auth tokens may have been invalidated
   - Re-pair devices through integration setup
   - Check if devices were factory reset
2. **Token Storage**:
   - Verify config.json contains valid tokens
   - Check file permissions for config directory
   - Backup and restore configuration if needed
3. **Device Reset**:
   - If devices were reset, tokens become invalid
   - Delete integration and set up again
   - Follow pairing process for all devices

**Problem**: Some devices missing from interface

**Solutions**:
1. **Network Discovery**:
   - Not all devices may be discovered initially
   - Try restarting integration
   - Use manual device addition if available
2. **API Compatibility**:
   - Very old devices may not support API
   - Check firmware version (need 3.0+)
   - Update firmware through Nanoleaf app
3. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Check config.json for all devices
   - Verify device entries are properly formatted
   - Re-run setup to refresh device list

### Debug Information

**Check Integration Logs**:
```bash
# Via web configurator
http://YOUR_REMOTE_IP/configurator ‚Üí settings ‚Üí development ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí choose Nanoleaf logs
```

**Test Device API Access**:
```bash
# Test API connectivity (should return 401)
curl http://DEVICE_IP:16021/api/v1/

# Test device pairing
curl -X POST http://DEVICE_IP:16021/api/v1/new

# Test authenticated access (replace TOKEN)
curl http://DEVICE_IP:16021/api/v1/TOKEN
```

**Verify mDNS Discovery**:
```bash
# List Nanoleaf services (Linux/Mac)
avahi-browse -rt _nanoleafapi._tcp

# Windows equivalent
dns-sd -B _nanoleafapi._tcp
```

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "No Devices Found" | mDNS discovery failed | Check network connectivity |
| "Pairing Failed" | Device not in pairing mode | Hold power button until LEDs flash |
| "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" | Invalid/expired auth token | Re-run integration setup |
| "Connection Refused" | Network/firewall issue | Check port 16021 accessibility |
| "Device Offline" | Device not reachable | Check device power and network |

## üóÉÔ∏è Advanced Setup

### Network Configuration

**Optimal Network Setup**:
- Use 2.4GHz WiFi for maximum range and stability
- Ensure strong signal strength at all device locations
- Avoid network congestion during setup
- Consider mesh network for large installations

**Firewall Configuration**:
```bash
# Required ports (if using firewall)
Port 16021/TCP  # Nanoleaf API
Port 5353/UDP   # mDNS discovery
```

### Device Organization Tips

**Naming Strategy**:
```bash
# Use descriptive names in Nanoleaf app
"Living Room Main Panels"    # Better than "Light Panels"
"Kitchen Canvas"             # Better than "Canvas 1"
"Bedroom Reading Light"      # Better than "Shapes"
```

**Layout Planning**:
- Group devices by room for logical organization
- Consider lighting zones for complex setups
- Plan for future expansion with consistent naming

### Performance Optimization

**Network Optimization**:
- Use wired connection for Remote Two/3 when possible
- Ensure stable WiFi for all Nanoleaf devices
- Monitor for interference on 2.4GHz band
- Consider QoS for smart home traffic

**Device Management**:
- Keep device firmware updated through Nanoleaf app
- Regularly test device responsiveness
- Clean device panels for optimal light output
- Monitor power consumption for large installations
